# VPlay - video Calling Web App

VPlay is a Java-based web application designed to provide secure, interactive, real-time communication between users through a friend-based system. It includes user registration, login, friend requests, notifications, and one-to-one call functionality—all managed with secure practices and a built-in chatbot powered by DJL and BERT for project-related queries.

## 🌐 Features

### 🔐 User Registration & Login
- Users can register using a **unique username**, **email ID**, and a **strong password** (minimum 8 characters, must include letters, digits, and special characters).
- After successful registration, an **email notification** is sent to the user.
- Secure password storage is ensured via **password hashing**.
- Users can log in using their **username and password**.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Friend System
- View your current list of friends.
- Send friend requests to existing users.
- Receive and respond to friend requests via the **notification system** (Accept or Reject).
- Friendship is **mutual**—both users must agree.

### 📞 Call Feature
- Users can initiate a **video call** by entering their friend’s **registered email ID**.
- If they are mutual friends, an **invitation link** is sent to the friend via email.
- Once both users open the link, they are connected in **real-time**.
- **Calls cannot be initiated with non-friends**, ensuring secure communication.

### 🔔 Notifications
- Displays incoming **friend requests** and **call invitations**.
- Notifications are accessible only to **logged-in users**.

### 🤖 Chatbot
- An embedded chatbot answers user questions about the project.
- Powered by **DJL (Deep Java Library)** and **BERT model**.
- Queries are matched against a set of internal documents describing the project flow and features(not stable).
